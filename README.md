# prework-study-guide

## Description

As a part of the prework for a programming bootcamp I created a study guide so that I have a sole place to go for all the information I have learned.
During the building of my guide I learned how to use Git and Bash commands in the console as well as write and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Best use of this stuidy guide is to use it as a cheat sheet. Have it open when completing assignments/projects, and don't be discouraged if you find yourself using it a lot, that's why it's here.

There are sections for Git and Bash Commands, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Git and Bash Commands has subsections for Bash Commands, Staging and Changing Branches, Updating and Merging, and Inspecting and Comparing.

If you open the DevTools, Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (macOS), 
you will see the console panel which will show you a list of the topics that are covered along with a suggestion of what to study first.
